# framelessQt

My take on modern frameless UI toolset in Qt/PySide2, wrapped in a pypi package.

**Currently I am still in the process of migrating code so currently this repo is useless.  
I will remove this note once the package is ready to use**

Includes a useful set of widgets:
- Side Navigation
  - Inspired by mobile app/website design
- Viewer
  - For inspecting images, with zoom and fit in view functionality
- Drag & Drop
  - Rectangular area for specifying input/output files or paths, with optional bracket icons
- Menu Bar
  - Displays large icon, title and window commands
- Footer
  - Displays optional memory and disk consumption indicators

Original idea comes from [qtmodern](https://github.com/gmarull/qtmodern).  
Dark stylesheet borrowed from [here](https://gist.github.com/lschmierer/443b8e21ad93e2a2d7eb).  
Mouse event code borrowed from [Megascans LiveLink for UE4](https://github.com/Quixel/Megascans-UE4LiveLink).
