# framelessQt

My take on modern frameless UI toolset in Qt/PySide2, compiled in a pypi package.

* I am still in the process of migrating code so currently this repo is useless. I will remove this line once the package is ready to use *

Includes a useful set of widgets:
- Side Navigation
  - inspired by mobile app/website design
- Viewer
  - for inspecting images, with zoom and fit in view functionality
- Drag & Drop
  - for specifying input/output files or paths
- Menu Bar
  - with large icon and window commands
- Footer
  - with optional memory and disk consumption indicators

Original idea comes from [qtmodern](https://github.com/gmarull/qtmodern).
Dark stylesheet borrowed from [here](https://gist.github.com/lschmierer/443b8e21ad93e2a2d7eb).
Mouse event code borrowed from [Megascans LiveLink for UE4](https://github.com/Quixel/Megascans-UE4LiveLink).
